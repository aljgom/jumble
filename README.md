Jumble
====================
#Instructions 
Can you create a program to solve a word jumble?  
([More info here.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumble))  The program should accept a string 
as input, and then return a list of words that can be
created using the submitted letters.  For example, on
the input "dog", the program should return a set of 
words including "god", "do", and "go".
 
Please implement the program in Python but refrain
from using any helper modules or imports (e.g. itertools). 
In order to verify your words, just download an 
English word list.
